the alpha=.3

In this run we experiment with decaying LinUCB strategy.
1. For day 1 we find the best decay parameter from [1 - 1.0/(4**i) for i in range(1,15)] and alpha sweep over [.2*i for i in range(1,5)].
2. Code is added in the LinUCB datastrcutre to account for the weight.
3. This translates into weighted ridge regression.
4. Following is the decay strategy
	D = (1-weight)*D + weight*outerProduct(featureVectore, featureVector)
	A = I*\lambda + D
	b = (1-weight)*b + weight*reward*featureVector
