In this run we experiment with decaying LinUCB strategy.
1. For day 1 we find the best decay parameter from .1 to .9 with increment of .1.
2. Code is added in the LinUCB datastrcutre to account for the weight.
3. This translates into weighted ridge regression.
4. Following is the decay strategy
	A = (1-weight)*A + weight*outerProduct(featureVectore, featureVector)
	b = (1-weight)*b + weight*reward*featureVector
